# SVM-classification
In this program I used Data set on breast cancer.then the data is splited into train and set data.
data is trained using softmargin SVC using Gaussina kernel. Box plots are created for knowing the data and then scaling of data to scale the similar magnitude of features.
Acuracy is checked  on training data and test data.
Now, I am checking the accuracy value by shifting the C values.
By using Parivalues function I tried to know the weights of different features. and their graphs.by analysing the graphs I tried to usa PCA ( principle component Analysis to reduce the feature dimensions.By reducing the features we can conclude that error increased.
Conclusion: Scaling imporves the accuracy by elimination the less magnitude weights, Also using extensive PCA decreases acuracy because of eliminating lot of important features.
